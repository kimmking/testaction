+Apache ShardingSphere 5.x 的首个版本发布在即。Apache ShardingSphere 从架构设计理念到产品定位都有重大革新。采用了可插拔的方式，使其具备高度灵活、可插拔和可扩展的能力;在产品定位方面，不再以数据分片为内核，而是转向分布式数据库生态的打造。5.x 版本将数据分片、分布式事务、数据库治理等核心功能从项目内核中完全抽离，成为其可插拔生态的一部分。并且通过 SPI 的方式完全开放其生态，将数据迁移、弹性调度、数据加密、影子表等功能完全融入至产品生态中。

+The first version of Apache ShardingSphere 5.x will be released soon. In version 5.x, Apache ShardingSphere has made significant innovations from architecture design to product scope. Apache ShardingSphere 5.x follow pluggable architecture design concept to build a flexible, embeddable and extensible project. Apache ShardingSphere 5. X no longer takes data sharding as kernel, but turns to building distributed database ecosystem. In the new version, core functions such as data sharding, distributed transaction and database governance are completely separated from the kernel and become a part of its pluggable component. Through SPI, the ecosystem is fully opened, and the functions of data migration, elastic scheduling, data encryption, shadow table are fully integrated into the product ecology. This presentation will comprehensively introduce the new features of Apache ShardingSphere 5.x.

+Apache sharingsphere is the only database middleware project of Apache foundation. It is mainly used in distributed database related scenarios such as data fragmentation, distributed transaction and distributed governance. This live broadcast will share why we want to participate in open source; the Apache software foundation, the core principles of Apache shardingsphere and how to embark on the road of open source.

+With the rapid development of the Internet, the scale of Internet data is also explosive growth. In this scenario, how to transform and upgrade the traditional database to meet the data needs of the new Internet? How to build an ecosystem of distributed database cluster with the help of NewSQL concept to meet the business needs of query performance, large amount of data storage, data security, elastic expansion, etc? This sharing will analyze these problems in detail and provide a relatively complete NewSQL solution.
