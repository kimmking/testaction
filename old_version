-  In the past few decades, relational database continuously occupy an absolute dominant position in the field of databases. The advantages of relational database, like stability, safety, ease of use that are the cornerstone of a modern system. With the rapid development of the Internet, databases built on stand-alone systems are no longer able to meet higher and higher concurrent requests and larger and larger data storage requirements. Therefore, distributed databases are more and more widely adopted.
+ Relational databases have dominated the database field for the past few decades, and the stability, security, and ease of use they bring have become the cornerstone for building modern systems. With the rapid development of the Internet, the database structured in a stand-alone system has been unable to meet the increasingly high concurrent requests and increasingly large data storage needs, therefore, distributed database are more widely adopted.

+Historically, the database space has been dominated by Western technology companies and communities. Apache ShardingSphere is one of these distributed database solutions and is currently the only database middleware in the Apache Software Foundation.

-Apache ShardingSphere is an ecosystem of open source distributed database middleware solutions, It consists of three independent products, Sharding-JDBC, Sharding-Proxy, and Sharding-Sidecar (planned). They all provide functions such as standardized data sharding, distributed transactions, and distributed governance, and can be applied to various diverse application scenarios such as Java isomorphism, heterogeneous languages, and cloud native. With the continuous exploration of Apache ShardingSphere in query optimizer and distributed transaction engine, it has gradually broken the product boundary of the implementation solution and evolved into an aggressive and stable platform-level solution.
+Apache ShardingSphere is an open source ecosystem distributed database middleware solutions, consisting of three separate products, Sharding-JDBC, Sharding-Proxy, and Sharding-Sidecar (planned). They all provide standardized data sharding, distributed transactions, and distributed governance for a variety of diverse application scenarios such as Java Isomorphic, heterogeneous languages, and cloud-native. As Apache ShardingSphere continues to explore query optimizers and distributed transaction engines, it has gradually broken the product boundaries of implementations and evolved into a platform-level solution that is both aggressive and stable all in one.
