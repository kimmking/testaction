 Streaming merge means that each time the data is fetched from the result set, the correct individual data can be returned by fetching it one by one, which is most compatible with the way the database returns the result set natively. Traversal, sorting, and Stream Group-by Merger are all types of stream imputation.
 
 In-memory merging, on the other hand, requires that all data in the result set be traversed and stored in memory, and then after unified grouping, sorting, and aggregation calculations, it is encapsulated to return the result set of data accessed one item at a time.

 The decorator merge is a unified functional enhancement of all the result set merge, currently the decorator merge only paging this type of merge.

 #### Iteration Merger 
 It is the simplest form of aggregation. Simply merge multiple result sets into a one-way chain table. After iterating through the current result set in the chain table, move the chain table element back one place and continue to iterate through the next result set.

 However, it is also important to note that a large amount of data still needs to be transferred to Sharding-Sphere's memory space due to the sorting needs. Therefore, it is not a best practice to use LIMIT for Pagination in this manner. Since LIMIT does not query data by index, Pagination by ID is a better solution if continuity of ID can be guaranteed, e.g..
