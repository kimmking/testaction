      <description>Apache sharingsphere is the only database middleware project of Apache foundation. It is mainly used in distributed database related scenarios such as data fragmentation, distributed transaction and distributed governance. This live broadcast will share why we want to participate in open source; the Apache software foundation, the core principles of Apache shardingsphere and how to embark on the road of open source.

      <description>With the rapid development of the Internet, the scale of Internet data is also explosive growth. In this scenario, how to transform and upgrade the traditional database to meet the data needs of the new Internet? How to build an ecosystem of distributed database cluster with the help of NewSQL concept to meet the business needs of query performance, large amount of data storage, data security, elastic expansion, etc? This sharing will analyze these problems in detail and provide a relatively complete NewSQL solution.</description>

      <description>The first version of Apache ShardingSphere 5.x will be released soon. In version 5.x, Apache ShardingSphere has made significant innovations from architecture design to product scope. Apache ShardingSphere 5.x follow pluggable architecture design concept to build a flexible, embeddable and extensible project. Apache ShardingSphere 5. X no longer takes data sharding as kernel, but turns to building distributed database ecosystem. In the new version, core functions such as data sharding, distributed transaction and database governance are completely separated from the kernel and become a part of its pluggable component.</description>
