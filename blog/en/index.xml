      <description>How we build a distributed database Author | Liang Zhang
Relational databases have dominated the database field for the past few decades, and the stability, security, and ease of use they bring have become the cornerstone for building modern systems. With the rapid development of the Internet, the database structured in a stand-alone system has been unable to meet the increasingly high concurrent requests and increasingly large data storage needs, therefore, distributed database are more widely adopted.</description>

      <description>With the rapid development of the Internet, the scale of Internet data is also explosive growth. In this scenario, how to transform and upgrade the traditional database to meet the data needs of the new Internet? How to build an ecosystem of distributed database cluster with the help of NewSQL concept to meet the business needs of query performance, large amount of data storage, data security, elastic expansion, etc? This sharing will analyze these problems in detail and provide a relatively complete NewSQL solution.</description>

      <description>The first version of Apache ShardingSphere 5.x will be released soon. In version 5.x, Apache ShardingSphere has made significant innovations from architecture design to product scope. Apache ShardingSphere 5.x follow pluggable architecture design concept to build a flexible, embeddable and extensible project. Apache ShardingSphere 5. X no longer takes data sharding as kernel, but turns to building distributed database ecosystem. In the new version, core functions such as data sharding, distributed transaction and database governance are completely separated from the kernel and become a part of its pluggable component.</description>

      <description>Apache ShardingSphere merged Seata AT distributed transactions Background Seata is a distributed transaction framework that jointly created by Ali group and Ant Financial services group. The current version of seata includes AT and TCC transaction. The goal of AT transaction is to provide incremental transaction ACID semantics under the micro service architecture, which let the users use distributed transactions just like local transactions. The core concept is the same as ShardingSphere.</description>

      <description>The mixed open-source distributed transaction solution Author Liang Zhang，Leader of Data R&amp;amp;D of JD.com, initiator &amp;amp; PPMC of Apache ShardingSphere.
Love open source, currently leading open source project ShardingSphere (formerly known as Sharding-JDBC) and Elastic-Job. Good at using Java as the popular distributed architecture and Kubernetes and Mesos as the popular cloud platform, admiring elegant codes, and having more research on how to write expressive codes.
At present, focus on improving ShardingSphere to be the industry&amp;rsquo;s first-class financial data solution.</description>
