		<h2 id="congratulations-on-graduation-of-apache-shardingsphere-as-a-top-level-project">Congratulations on graduation of Apache ShardingSphere as a Top-Level Project!</h2>
<p>Apache Software Foundation (ASF), The most popular open-source software foundation, announced Apache ShardingSphere as a Top-Level Project (TLP) on Wakefield, MA, 16th April 2020.</p>
<p>ShardingSphere entered into the Apache incubator since 10th November 2018. With the help of mentors and the whole community, The Apache board approved its graduation proposal with 10 +1 votes successfully, which ends up its 17 months incubator and promotes it as TLP.</p>
<p>As the first project graduating from Incubator in 2020, this cheering news was published subsequently on Apache official blog with the support of Sally Khudairi, Vice President Marketing &amp; Publicity of ASF.</p>
<p>Apache ShardingSphere was born in dangdang.com, grew up fastly in JD.com, and now becomes a famous Apache distributed database middleware ecosystem. The evolvement from a light JDBC driver into an ecosystem presents the efforts and enthusiasm of the whole community in the past 17 months.</p>
<p>Special thanks for the guidance from IPMCs, mentors. Many thanks for contributions from 120+ committers all over the world. What&rsquo;s more, we are glad to see the community still move actively during the coronavirus outbreak.</p>
