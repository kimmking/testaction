      <title>Heartbeat Detection</title>

      <description>Background The ShardingSphere governance module is designed to provide a more efficient and automated cluster management feature. This depends on the state of each node in the cluster, and the real-time connection state between each node is also essential for automated cluster management.
The heartbeat detection is responsible for collecting the real-time connection state between the application and the databases to provide support for subsequent automated management and scheduling.
Program  Initialize the heartbeat detection module according to the configuration when the application starts The heartbeat detection module starts the heartbeat detection task, periodically obtains the database connection associated with the instance and executes heartbeat detection SQL Process the heartbeat detection result and persist it to the registry center  Data Structure The heartbeat detection result is persist to the instances node of registry center:</description>

      <title>Cluster State Topology</title>

      <description>Background The cluster status topology is used to display the status of all nodes in the cluster and the communication between the nodes. ShardingSphere collects and stores heartbeat data in the registration center based on heartbeat detection to generate the cluster state topology map, which is used to more intuitively display the real-time status of each node in the cluster and the connection between application nodes and database nodes.
Goal  Real-time display of application node and database node state changes Real-time display of the connection status between application nodes and database nodes Database nodes, such as abnormal connection with more than a certain number of application nodes, alert and remind (update node status)  Node Status Description  ONLINE online OFFLINE offline DISABLED disabled UNKNOWN unknown  Use The cluster state topology is integrated in the user interface.</description>
