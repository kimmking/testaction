      <description>Background APM is the abbreviation for application performance monitoring. Currently, main APM functions lie in the performance diagnosis of distributed systems, including chain demonstration, application topology analysis and so on.
Apache ShardingSphere is not responsible for gathering, storing and demonstrating APM data, but sends the core information of SQL parsing and enforcement to APM to process. In other words, Apache ShardingSphere is only responsible for generating valuable data and submitting it to relevant systems through standard protocol.</description>

      <description>Background Metrics are measures of used to evaluate the performance of a system at run time. Quantitative assessment can be used to evaluate the performance of a system and to give relevant opinions on system optimization or business strategy. Apache ShardingSphere aims to build a distributed database solution. For the database,it analyzes its running status,connection data,transaction number,throughput and other relevant indicators. It is particularly important to provide visual advice and help for database scheduling,data smooth migration,sharding-database,sharding-table and other policies.</description>
